Okay, I understand the goal! You want to build an application using the provided Python PyQt6 templates (powertoys_run_ui_v3_Minimalist.py for the search bar and Editor.py for the full editor) to manage and quickly access your AI prompts.
Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this, combining your ideas and the templates:
Core Idea:
1.	Search Interface (Minimalist UI):
o	Acts as the primary, quick-access window.
o	You type keywords.
o	It searches your prompt database (SQLite).
o	Shows matching prompts (likely Title and maybe Category/Section).
o	Clicking (or pressing Enter on) a result copies the full prompt text to your clipboard.
o	Has a button to open the full Editor.

2.	Editor Interface (Editor UI):
o	Launched from the Search Interface.
o	Allows you to organize prompts in a hierarchy:
ÔÇß	Level 1: Category (e.g., "Writing", "Coding", "Image Generation")
ÔÇß	Level 2: Section (e.g., under "Writing": "Emails", "Blog Posts"; under "Coding": "Python", "SQL")
ÔÇß	Level 3: Prompt (The actual prompt with a Title and the full text content).
o	Uses the 3-panel layout from Editor.py for Categories, Sections, and Prompts.
o	Lets you Add, Edit, and Delete Categories, Sections, and Prompts.
o	Saves all data to the SQLite database.

3.	Database (SQLite):
o	A single file (e.g., prompts.db) will store everything.
o	Tables for Categories, Sections, and Prompts, linked together.


Clarifying Questions (Simple English & Examples):
To make sure I build exactly what you need, please help me with these points:
1.	Opening the Search Bar: How do you want to open the search bar window (MinimalistSearchUI)?
make shortcut using win + space it will popup the search bar.

2.	Search Scope: When you type in the search bar, what exactly should it search for?
Just the Prompt Title?
after i type show items it will show title "Python Code Explainer" under describtions. please add describtion bar in editor.


3.	Search Results Display: In the search results list, what information should appear for each prompt?
it should show Category > Section > Prompt Title under this will show the describtion.


4.	Editor Button: The MinimalistSearchUI has a search icon (üîç) on the left now.
i love this icon"settings" ‚öôÔ∏è.


5.	Hierarchy Confirmation: You mentioned Level 1, 2, 3. Just to confirm, is this mapping correct?
o	Level 1 = Category (like 'Writing', 'Coding')
o	Level 2 = Section (like 'Emails', 'Python Scripts')
o	Level 3 = Prompt (the actual prompt text with its own title)
yes.


Proposed Plan:
Once I have your answers, here's how I'll proceed:
1.	Database Setup: Design the SQLite tables (Categories, Sections, Prompts) and create Python functions to interact with the database (add, edit, delete, search).

2.	Adapt Editor UI:
o	Modify Editor.py.
o	Replace the NoteData class and its JSON logic with our new SQLite database functions.
o	Rename "Notebook", "Section", "Page" in the UI and code to "Category", "Section", "Prompt".
o	Ensure the 3-panel view correctly displays and manages Categories, Sections, and Prompts from the database.
o	Keep the text editor part for viewing/editing the main prompt content.

3.	Adapt Search UI:
o	Modify powertoys_run_ui_v3_Minimalist.py.
o	Change the add_search_results function to query the SQLite database based on your search scope preference.
o	Update the list items to display prompt information as you specified.
o	Implement the "copy to clipboard" action when a result is selected (e.g., on item click or Enter key press).
o	Add/Modify the button on the left to launch the Editor window.

4.	Integration: Connect the two UIs so the button in the Search UI correctly hides itself and shows the Editor UI.

5.	(Optional, based on your answer to Q1): Implement the global hotkey if needed (this requires an extra library like pynput or keyboard).
Let me know your thoughts on the questions! Your answers will help shape the final application.
